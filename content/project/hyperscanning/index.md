**Short Description**

During a conversation, speakers tend to converge towards each other. This phenomenon is called speech convergence. Aim of this project is to find what happens in the participants brain during speech convergence.

The steps are -

- Quantifying speech convergence and mark the time points in the conversation.
- Using the markers we group the corresponding brain recordings and find some neural markers.
